# autobus

Autobus is an integration bus.  It consists of integrators deployed in a peer to peer network.  Those may have adapters embedded in them which work with particular systems.

The initial version focuses on mapping integrated systems and their dependencies.

The ultimate goal is to support a variety of data movement and virtualization modes, including batch, request reply and streaming.
